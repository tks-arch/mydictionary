Chapter 1: The Forgotten Book;

Leo loved his school library. It was a quiet and peaceful place. Most students went there only to study for tests, but Leo liked to read the old books in the back corner.

One rainy afternoon, he found a book he had never seen before. It was on the lowest shelf, covered in dust. The title was simple: Tales of Northwood High. The book had a dark blue leather cover with no pictures.

He opened it carefully. The pages were yellow and smelled like old paper. Inside, he found stories about his school from a long time ago. But between page 34 and 35, there was a loose piece of paper. It wasn't a page from the book. It was a small, folded note.

Leo unfolded it. On the paper, there was a handwritten message. It was not a story. It was a riddle.

Where the sun sleeps and stories wake, A silent keeper a promise makes. Follow the light to find the sign, A treasure of the past can be thine.

Leo read the riddle again and again. A treasure? Here, in the school? He felt a new excitement. This was much more interesting than his homework. He decided he had to solve this mystery.

Chapter 2: The First Clue;

The next day, Leo showed the riddle to his best friend, Mia. Mia was very smart and practical.

"A treasure hunt? Are you serious, Leo?" she asked, but she was smiling. "Okay, let's see it."

They read the first line together. "Where the sun sleeps and stories wake."

"The sun sleeps at night," Mia said. "So maybe we need to come to the library at night?"

"We can't do that," Leo replied. "Think about it differently. 'Stories wake' here in the library. So, where does the sun 'sleep' in this room?"

Leo looked around the big library. His eyes stopped on the large window on the west wall. "The setting sun!" he shouted quietly. "The sun sets in the west. The light of the setting sun comes through that window. It 'sleeps' there for the night!"

They walked over to the old, wooden window frame. The afternoon sun was shining through it, making the dust in the air sparkle. They looked closely at the frame.

"Look!" Mia whispered. She pointed to a small mark carved into the wood. It was a tiny drawing of an open book.

"This is the sign," Leo said. "The riddle is real!"

They felt a thrill of discovery. They had found the first clue. Now, they had to understand the next part of the riddle.

Chapter 3: The Silent Keeper;

Their excitement faded as they thought about the second line: "A silent keeper a promise makes."

"A silent keeper? Who could that be?" Mia wondered. "Maybe a teacher who is very quiet? Mr. Harrison from the science department doesn't talk much."

Leo shook his head. "I don't think it's a person. A person isn't always silent. This sounds like an object."

They spent the rest of the afternoon thinking. They looked at the big clock on the wall. It was not silent. They looked at the statues of the school's founders. They were silent, but they didn't seem to be "keepers."

Leo was ready to give up for the day, but then he saw it. In the darkest corner of the library was something students never used anymore: the old card catalog. It was a tall wooden cabinet with hundreds of small drawers. It "kept" the information of every book before computers were used.

"The card catalog!" Leo said. "It's the keeper of all the book titles. It has thousands of stories inside, but it never speaks!"

Mia's eyes opened wide. "You're a genius, Leo!"

They ran to the cabinet and started opening the small drawers. They were empty and full of dust. But then Mia found one drawer that was different. It had the same small book symbol carved on its handle.

Chapter 4: The Brass Key;

With shaking hands, Leo pulled the drawer open. Inside, there was no treasure map and no gold. There was only one small, old-fashioned key made of brass. It was heavy and dark with age.

"A key?" Mia said, a little disappointed. "What does this open?"

They looked at the last two lines of the riddle again.

Follow the light to find the sign, A treasure of the past can be thine.

"We followed the light to the window," Leo thought aloud. "And we found the sign. But the key... where does it go?"

They sat down at a table, feeling stuck. The key could be for any door or box in the whole school.

"Let's think about the whole riddle," Mia suggested. "It's from an old book about the school's history. So the treasure is probably something old. Where would someone hide an old box?"

Leo looked out the library window at the school grounds. His eyes focused on the huge oak tree in the center of the courtyard. It was the oldest tree in the area. Students often called it "The Old Guardian."

"The 'treasure of the past'," Leo said slowly. "Maybe it's not in a building. Maybe it's under the oldest thing at this school."

Mia followed his gaze to the oak tree. "It's worth a try," she said.

Chapter 5: A Treasure of Time;

After school, Leo and Mia went to the giant oak tree. They looked around its base. Among the roots, they saw a flat stone that looked different from the others.

They worked together to lift the stone. Underneath, there was a small, dark hole. Inside the hole was a metal box, locked with an old, rusty lock.

"The key," Mia said, her voice full of excitement.

Leo put the brass key into the lock. It was a perfect fit. He turned it, and with a small click, the box opened.

Inside, there was no gold or silver. Instead, they found a collection of small objects: a faded photograph of students from 1975, a school sports medal, and a carefully folded letter.

Leo picked up the letter and read it aloud.

"To the student who finds this box, We are the class of 1975. We did not have much money for a real treasure, but we wanted to leave something for the future. This box holds our memories. We hope you will see that school is not just about tests and grades. It is about friendship and dreams. We hope you are having a wonderful time at Northwood High. Sincerely, The History Club."

Leo and Mia looked at each other. They didn't find gold, but they had found something better. They found a connection to students from fifty years ago. They were just like them.

"This is the real treasure," Mia said softly.

They carefully put everything back in the box, adding a small note of their own with a picture of them smiling. They locked the box and put it back under the stone, keeping the secret safe for the next generation of students to find.
